/**
 * <p>This works in conjunction with a window and the inspector panel to
 * manage loading, saving, and editing of a theme document.<br />
 * A theme document is a bundle containing the theme resources and
 * (perhaps) a loadable binary ... when we support it.
 * </p>
 * <p>Basically, the idea of the user interface is that the document window
 * provides a few icons you can click on to raise an inspector for editing.
 * </p>
 * <list>
 *   <item>System colors</item>
 *   <item>System images</item>
 *   <item>Menu settings</item>
 *   <item>Window settings</item>
 * </list>
 * <p>Everything else in the document window is a GUI element (NSControl)
 * and clicking on one of the elements should select it and activate the
 * inspector for it, which should let you change any NSInterfaceStyle keys for
 * the element and let you set an image/images for tiling over the rectangle
 * to draw it.
 * </p>
 * <p>For more complex GUI elements, it should be possible to click inside
 * the selected element to select a subsidiary element within int, and provide
 * theme info for that (eg. the knob inside a scroller).
 * </p>
 * <p>Any action to change part of the theme configuration should be
 * immediately made visible by changing the running application to effectively
 * use the modified theme.
 * </p>
